\title{Returns significance data from a snapshot.}
\usage{
iterateSimulations(originalData, useAssay = "counts", realLabels,
  totalReads, cells, iterations)
}
\arguments{
\item{originalData}{SCtkExperiment. The SCtkExperiment object storing all
assay data from the shiny app.}

\item{useAssay}{Character. The name of the assay to be used for subsampling.}

\item{realLabels}{Character. The name of the condition of interest. Must match
a name from sample data.}

\item{totalReads}{Numeric. The total number of reads in the simulated
dataset, to be split between all simulated cells.}

\item{cells}{Numeric. The number of virtual cells to simulate.}

\item{iterations}{Numeric. How many times should each experimental design be
simulated.}
}
\value{
A matrix of significance information from a snapshot
}
\description{
Returns significance data from a snapshot.
