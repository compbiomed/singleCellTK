\title{Construct SCE object from BUStools output}
\usage{
importBUStools(
  BUStoolsDirs,
  samples,
  matrixFileNames = "genes.mtx",
  featuresFileNames = "genes.genes.txt",
  barcodesFileNames = "genes.barcodes.txt",
  gzipped = "auto",
  class = c("Matrix", "matrix"),
  delayedArray = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{BUStoolsDirs}{A vector of paths to BUStools output files. Each sample
should have its own path. For example: \code{./genecount}.
Must have the same length as \code{samples}.}

\item{samples}{A vector of user-defined sample names for the samples to be
imported. Must have the same length as \code{BUStoolsDirs}.}

\item{matrixFileNames}{Filenames for the Market Exchange Format (MEX) sparse
matrix files (.mtx files). Must have length 1 or the same
length as \code{samples}.}

\item{featuresFileNames}{Filenames for the feature annotation files.
Must have length 1 or the same length as \code{samples}.}

\item{barcodesFileNames}{Filenames for the cell barcode list file.
Must have length 1 or the same length as \code{samples}.}

\item{gzipped}{Boolean. \code{TRUE} if the BUStools output files
(barcodes.txt, genes.txt, and genes.mtx) were
gzip compressed. \code{FALSE} otherwise. This is \code{FALSE} in BUStools
0.39.4. Default \code{"auto"} which automatically detects if the
files are gzip compressed. Must have length 1 or the same length as
\code{samples}.}

\item{class}{Character. The class of the expression matrix stored in the SCE
object. Can be one of "Matrix" (as returned by
\link[Matrix]{readMM} function), or "matrix" (as returned by
\link[base]{matrix} function). Default "Matrix".}

\item{delayedArray}{Boolean. Whether to read the expression matrix as
\link[DelayedArray]{DelayedArray} object or not. Default \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{SingleCellExperiment} object containing the count
 matrix, the gene annotation, and the cell annotation.
}
\description{
Read the barcodes, features (genes), and matrix from BUStools
 output. Import them
 as one \link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment} object. Note the
 cells in the output files for BUStools 0.39.4 are not filtered.

\examples{
# Example #1
# FASTQ files were downloaded from
# https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0
# /pbmc_1k_v3
# They were concatenated as follows:
# cat pbmc_1k_v3_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz pbmc_1k_v3_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz >
# pbmc_1k_v3_R1.fastq.gz
# cat pbmc_1k_v3_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz pbmc_1k_v3_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz >
# pbmc_1k_v3_R2.fastq.gz
# The following BUStools command generates the gene, cell, and
# matrix files

# bustools correct -w ./3M-february-2018.txt -p output.bus | \
#   bustools sort -T tmp/ -t 4 -p - | \
#   bustools count -o genecount/genes \
#     -g ./transcripts_to_genes.txt \
#     -e matrix.ec \
#     -t transcripts.txt \
#     --genecounts -

# The top 20 genes and the first 20 cells are included in this example.
