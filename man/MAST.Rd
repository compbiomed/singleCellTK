\usage{
MAST(inSCE, condition = NULL, interest.level = NULL, freqExpressed = 0.1,
  fcThreshold = log2(1.5), p.value = 0.05, useThresh = FALSE,
  useAssay = "logcounts")

thresholdGenes(inSCE, useAssay = "logcounts")

MASTviolin(inSCE, useAssay = "logcounts", fcHurdleSig, samplesize = 49,
  threshP = FALSE, condition)

MASTregression(inSCE, useAssay = "logcounts", fcHurdleSig, samplesize = 49,
  threshP = FALSE, condition)
}
\arguments{
\item{inSCE}{Input SCtkExperiment object. Required}

\item{condition}{select variable (from the colData) that is used for the model.}

\item{interest.level}{If the condition of interest has more than two factors,
indicate which level should be used to compare to all other samples.}

\item{freqExpressed}{Filter genes that are expressed in at least this
fraction of cells. The default is expression in 0.1 of samples.}

\item{fcThreshold}{Minimum fold change for differentially expressed gene.}

\item{p.value}{p values for selecting the hurdle result, default is 0.05}

\item{useThresh}{Use adaptive thresholding to filter genes. The default is
FALSE.}

\item{useAssay}{The assay to use for the MAST calculations. The default is
"logcounts"}

\item{fcHurdleSig}{The filtered result from hurdle model}

\item{samplesize}{The number of most significant genes}

\item{threshP}{Plot threshold values from adaptive thresholding. Default is
FALSE}
}
\value{
MAST(): A data.frame of differentially expressed genes with p-values.

thresholdGenes(): list of thresholded counts (on natural scale),
thresholds, bins, densities estimated on each bin, and the original data from
MAST::thresholdSCRNACountMatrix

MASTviolin(): A ggplot object of MAST violin plots.

MASTregression(): A ggplot object of MAST linear regression plots.
