\usage{
MAST(SCEdata, condition = NULL, interest.level = NULL,
  freqExpressed = 0.1, fcThreshold = log2(1.5), p.value = 0.05,
  useThresh = FALSE, useAssay = "logcounts")
}
\arguments{
\item{SCEdata}{SCESet object}

\item{condition}{select variable (from the colData) that is used for the model.}

\item{interest.level}{If the condition of interest has more than two factors,
indicate which level should be used to compare to all other samples.}

\item{freqExpressed}{Filter genes that are expressed in at least this
fraction of cells. The default is expression in 0.1 of samples.}

\item{fcThreshold}{Minimum fold change for differentially expressed gene.}

\item{p.value}{p values for selecting the hurdle result, default is 0.05}

\item{useThresh}{Use adaptive thresholding to filter genes. The default is
FALSE.}

\item{useAssay}{The assay to use for the MAST calculations. The default is
"logcounts"}
}
\value{
A data.frame of differentially expressed genes with p-values.
}
\description{
Run MAST analysis on a SCESet object.
