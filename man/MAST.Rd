\usage{
MAST(SCEdata, condition = NULL, interest.level = NULL,
  freq_expressed = 0.1, fc_threshold = log2(1.5), p.value = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{SCEdata}{SCESet object}

\item{condition}{select varible (from the pdata) that is used for modle}

\item{interest.level}{If the condition of interest has more than two factors,
indicate which level should be used to compare to all other samples.}

\item{freq_expressed}{Filter genes that are expressed in at least this
fraction of cells. The default is expression in 0.1 of samples.}

\item{fc_threshold}{the threshold for filetering the sample}

\item{p.value}{p values for selecting the hurdle reslut, default is 0.05}
}
\description{
Run MAST analysis on a SCESet object.
