\title{Estimate numbers of detected genes, significantly differentially expressed
genes, and median significant effect size}
\usage{
DownsampleDepth(originalData, minCount = 10, minCells = 3,
  maxDepth = 1e+07, realLabels, depthResolution = 10, iterations = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{originalData}{Matrix. The original raw readcount matrix. When used
within the Shiny app, this will be assay(SCEsetObject, "counts").}

\item{minCount}{Numeric. The minimum number of reads found for a gene to be
considered detected.}

\item{minCells}{Numeric. The minimum number of cells a gene must have at
least 1 read in for it to be considered detected.}

\item{maxDepth}{Numeric. The highest number of total reads to be simulated.}

\item{realLabels}{Factor. The condition labels for differential expression.
If only two factors present, will default to t-test. If multiple factors,
will default to ANOVA.}

\item{depthResolution}{Numeric. How many different read depth should the
script simulate? Will simulate a number of experimental designs ranging from
10 reads to maxReadDepth, with logarithmic spacing.}

\item{iterations}{Numeric. How many times should each experimental design be
simulated?}
}
\value{
A 3-dimensional array, with dimensions = c(iterations,
depthResolution, 3). [,,1] contains the number of detected genes in each
simulated dataset, [,,2] contains the number of significantly differentially
expressed genes in each simulation, and [,,3] contains the mediansignificant
effect size in each simulation. If no genes are significantly differentially
expressed, the median effect size defaults to infinity.
