\title{Generates a single simulated dataset, bootstrapping from the input counts
matrix.}
\usage{
generateSimulatedData(totalReads, cells, originalData, realLabels)
}
\arguments{
\item{totalReads}{Numeric. The total number of reads in the simulated
dataset, to be split between all simulated cells.}

\item{cells}{Numeric. The number of virtual cells to simulate.}

\item{originalData}{Matrix. The original raw readcount matrix. When used
within the Shiny app, this will be assay(SCEsetObject, "counts").}

\item{realLabels}{Factor. The condition labels for differential expression.
If only two factors present, will default to t-test. If multiple factors,
will default to ANOVA.}
}
\value{
A simulated counts matrix, the first row of which contains the 'true'
labels for each virtual cell.
