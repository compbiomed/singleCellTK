\title{Calculate power to discover differentially expressed genes upon subsampling}
\usage{
differentialPower(datamatrix, downmatrix, conditions, genelist = FALSE,
  significance = 0.05, method = "tpm.t")
}
\arguments{
\item{datamatrix}{The original raw readcount matrix. When used within the Shiny app, this will be assay(SCEsetObject, "counts").}

\item{downmatrix}{The 4-dimensional array of simulated subsampled datasets. Produced by Downsample()}

\item{conditions}{A vector of conditions, such as treatment or batch. Passed as colData(SCtkExperiment)$treatment.}

\item{genelist}{Optional vector of genes to be searched for differential expression. If provided, diffexp will not be performed on the oringinal data.}

\item{significance}{Significance threshold, a float between 0 and 1 (exclusive).}

\item{method}{Which method should be used for differential expression. Default is simple tpm-based t-test for speed.}
}
\value{
A matrix of recapitulation - rows are genes that were differentially expressed in the original set (or passed as 'genelist'), columns are simulated depths.
