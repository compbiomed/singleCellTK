\title{Passes the output of generateSimulatedData() to differential expression
tests, picking either t-tests or ANOVA for data with only two conditions or
multiple conditions, respectively.}
\usage{
subDiffEx(tempData)

subDiffExttest(countMatrix, class.labels, test.type = "t.equalvar")

subDiffExANOVA(countMatrix, condition)
}
\arguments{
\item{tempData}{Matrix. The output of generateSimulatedData(), where the
first row contains condition labels.}

\item{countMatrix}{Matrix. A simulated counts matrix, sans labels.}

\item{class.labels}{Factor. The condition labels for the simulated cells.
Will be coerced into 1's and 0's.}

\item{test.type}{Type of test to perform. The default is t.equalvar.}

\item{condition}{Factor. The condition labels for the simulated cells.}
}
\value{
subDiffEx(): A vector of fdr-adjusted p-values for all genes.
Nonviable results (such as for genes with 0 counts in a simulated dataset)
are coerced to 1.

subDiffExttest(): A vector of fdr-adjusted p-values for all genes.
Nonviable results (such as for genes with 0 counts in a simulated dataset)
are coerced to 1.

subDiffExANOVA(): A vector of fdr-adjusted p-values for all genes.
Nonviable results (such as for genes with 0 counts in a simulated dataset)
are coerced to 1.

\itemize{
\item \code{subDiffEx}: 

\item \code{subDiffExttest}: Runs t-tests on all genes in a simulated dataset with 2
conditions, and adjusts for FDR.

\item \code{subDiffExANOVA}: Runs ANOVA on all genes in a simulated dataset with
more than 2 conditions, and adjusts for FDR.
