\title{Passes the output of generateSimulatedData() to differential expression
tests, picking either t-tests or ANOVA for data with only two conditions or
multiple conditions, respectively.}
\usage{
subDiffEx(tempData)
}
\arguments{
\item{tempData}{Matrix. The output of generateSimulatedData(), where the
first row contains condition labels.}
}
\value{
A vector of fdr-adjusted p-values for all genes. Nonviable results
(such as for genes with 0 counts in a simulated dataset) are coerced to 1.
