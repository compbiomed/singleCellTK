In this vignette, we will suggest a workflow for processing single cell RNA-Seq
data to produce an SCtkExperiment object that can be used in the single cell toolkit.

## Suggested Software

Some of the steps in this workflow are performed outside of R and are optional,
but they produce useful metrics that can be explored using the single cell
toolkit. Please see the individual tool websites for installation instructions.

* [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) - Command
line or GUI program for performing quality control on sequencing files
* [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/) - Command line tool that creates a combined
report from FastQC results run on individual files.
* [Rsubread](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rsubread.html) - R
package for alignment of fastq files to a reference genome

## Tutorial, Single Cell RNA-Seq Reads to Single Cell Object

### Step 1: FastQC Quality Control

Quality control performed on the FASTQ files can identify low quality or failed
samples that you may want to exclude from downstream analysis. FastQC is the
standard tool used for quality control of fastq files. Run FastQC on the command
line on each individual file:

```bash
fastqc input_read_1.fastq.gz
```

This command will create a fastqc HTML report and a zip file of fastqc result
files. To combine individual sample reports into a single report, use multiqc:

```bash
multiqc .
```

### Step 2: Gather sample annotations and feature annotations

The single cell object contains raw read counts, normalized expression data,
sample annotations, and feature annotations along with downstream analysis.
While you can make a single cell object with just a count matrix, to take
advantage of some of the analyses available in the single cell toolkit, sample
annotation information and feature information may be helpful.

#### Sample Annotation Data Frame

The sample annotation data frame should contain columns of annotation
information and row names that match the sample names in the count matrix. The
output table ```multiqc_fastqc.txt``` can be used as a sample annotation data
frame.

#### Feature Annotation Data Frame

The feature annotation data frame should contain columns of annotation
information and row names that match the row names in the count matrix.

### Step 3: Align the data with alignSingleCellData()

For basic alignment and feature counting you can use the
```alignSingleCellData()``` function in the single cell toolkit to align fastq
data to a reference genome, count the number of reads per gene, and create a
single cell object that contains annotation information. After running the
```alignSingleCellData()``` function you can take the single cell object
directly into the shiny app for downstream analysis. Detailed information about
the options available in the ```alignSingleCellData()``` function can be found
in the function help, but here is an example command:

> __NOTE__: Alignment to large genomes (the human genome) can take more than
> 8GB of memory. Make sure to run the ```alignSingleCellData()``` function
> from a computer with sufficient memory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
singlecellobject <- alignSingleCellData(inputfile1 = c(
  "/path/to/sample1_1.fastq.gz","/path/to/sample2_1.fastq.gz"),
  inputfile2 = c("/path/to/sample1_2.fastq.gz",
                 "/path/to/sample2_2.fastq.gz"),
  index_path = "/path/to/genome/index",
  gtf_annotation = "/path/to/gene/annotations.gtf",
  sample_annotations = sample.annotation.df,
  threads=4)
```

#### Parallelization

While setting the number of threads in the ```alignSingleCellData()``` function
will increase the speed of each individual alignment, the function will align
each sample sequentially. To save time, you may want to perform alignment and
feature counting on each file in a parallel computing environment and combine
the samples to create an SCtkExperiment object. The ```alignSingleCellData()``` function
can be run on an individual file. Once individual sample objects have been
created, combine them using the ```mergeSCESet()``` function.

## Creating a Single Cell Object from aligned BAM reads

If your data requires additional processing steps (UMI normalization, etc), you
can use the ```alignSingleCellData()``` function to perform feature counting
and create a single cell object without the alignment step if '.bam' files are
provided in the ```inputfile1``` parameter. Note that if your read data was
sequenced using paired-end reads, set the ```isPairedEnd``` parameter
```TRUE```.

## Manually Creating a Single Cell Object with createSCE()

If you choose to align and quantify your data using alternative tools, you can
use the ```createSCE()``` function to create a single cell object that can
be used in the single cell toolkit by providing a count data frame and
optionally providing sample and feature annotations. See the
```createSCE()``` function help page for details.
