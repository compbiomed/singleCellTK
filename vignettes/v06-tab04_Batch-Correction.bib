  abstract = "Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such
              as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of
              cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances
              permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell
              level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used
              and numerous publications are based on data produced with this
              technology. However, RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly
              different. In particular, unlike RNA-Seq, the majority of
              reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be
              either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time
              of measurement, or technically-driven, gene expressing RNA, but
              not at a sufficient level to detected by sequencing technology.
              Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the
              expression level to be zero varies substantially across single
              cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to
              what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by
              technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while
              systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely
              reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies,
              these issues have received minimal attention in published studies
              based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment
              experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate
              that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of
              observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we
              present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by
              technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more
              zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower
              expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is
              exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies
              cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell
              variability can be confused with novel biological results.
              Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and
              confounded experiments can intensify the problem.",

  abstract = "Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray
              studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing
              methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and
              non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for
              batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes
              and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We
              illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that
              our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in
              practice. Software for our method is freely available at:
